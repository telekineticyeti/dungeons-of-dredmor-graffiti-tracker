This project is a learning exercise for the NgRx framework. Data persists using browser localstorage.

The options includes options to export and import tag codes in JSON format, as well as load sample tag codes. The sample codes were parsed from the Gaslamps games forums [here](https://community.gaslampgames.com/threads/graffiti-dump-mostly-unexplored-codes.6538/).
